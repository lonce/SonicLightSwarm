
The comm ojbect manages message sending.

CLIENTS register for the incoming messages, and thereafter recieve callback when they are received:
	comm.registerCallback(message_name, cb_function);
and sends messages thus:
	comm.sendJSONmsg(message_name, data_array);

Internally, the comm module creates a message object:
{
	"n": //name of message, e.g. "note on",
	"d": //an array of data that the receiver knows how to parse based on the message name,
	"s": //an id uniquiely identifying the message sender 
}
JSONStrinifies it, and sends it to the server.
